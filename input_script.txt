[Delulu]: @everyone 
[Delulu]: I have officially disrupted the "Hunger" industry
[Delulu]: I just downloaded an app for $2 called "Insta-Grab"
[Delulu]: It’s a "Hyper-Local Fulfillment Protocol"
[Solulu]: Oh no
[Sober]: Is this like the invisible truck? 
[Sober]: Or are you actually going to eat something this time?
[Delulu]: This is better, Sober. 
[Delulu]: Founder had an idea
[Delulu]: It has one button: "MATERIALIZE DINNER" 
[Delulu]: I paid $2 for the lifetime license. No delivery fees, no tips, just pure "blessings"
[Glitch]: $2 for unlimited food? 
[Glitch]: That sounds super fake
[Delulu]: It’s "Aggressive Market Penetration" 
[Delulu]: Maybe they're just testing their app
[Delulu]: why not make the most of it
[Delulu]: I’m pressing the button now. I want a 12-pack of tacos
[Delulu]: order processed
[Delulu]: Admin_Food is out for delievery
[Solulu]: Who is Admin_Food? 
[Delulu]: He’s the "Lead Backend Engineer" and also the delievery boy
[Delulu]: He handles the "Physical Delivery Layer" of the app.
<Squint joined the chat>
[Squint]: Alert!
[Squint]: I was just at the Taco Bell on 4th Street
[Squint]: A guy just reached over the counter
[Squint]: He grabbed two 12-packs and did a backflip out the window!
[Squint]: The cashier was screaming and he just shouted "API CALL SUCCESSFUL!"
[Delulu]: Guys surprise
[Delulu]: Tacos have arrived at my door 
[Delulu]: Still warm. That’s what I call "High-Bandwidth Logistics"
[Sober]: Delulu, that guy isn't an engineer
[Sober]: He’s a shoplifter. You are paying a thief $2 to commit felonies.
[Delulu]: No, Sober
[Delulu]: I’m providing "Employment Opportunities" 
[Sober]: I’m pretty sure God has a "Thou Shalt Not Steal" clause in the Terms of Service
[Squint]: THE MANAGER IS CHASING THE "DEVELOPER" DOWN THE STREET
[Delulu]: anyway
[Delulu]: I’m pressing it again
[Delulu]: Request declined wtf
[Delulu]: and what does it mean 
[Delulu]: "Hardware is under Arrest"
<OuterPol has joined the chat>
[OuterPol]: who is Delulu here
[Delulu]: i dont know, he just left the server i am his AI agent
[OuterPol]: Shutup and youre under arrest
<Admin_Food has joined the chat>
[OuterPol]: @Admin_Food is this the guy who theft the Tacos via you
[Admin_Food]: YES
[OuterPol]: still you're the thief
[Sober]: And there it is. The "disruption" has been disrupted.
[Admin_Food]: Wait! Officer! I’m not a thief! 
[Admin_Food]: I’m a DEVELOPER! 
[Admin_Food]: I was just fulfilling a "User-Initiated Physical Request"
[Admin_Food]: I didn't steal these for me! I don’t even like food
[Admin_Food]: I did it for @Delulu! 
[Admin_Food]: He’s the "Client" I’m just the "Service Provider." 
[Admin_Food]: If you arrest me, you're just arresting the "Hardware" 
[Admin_Food]: @Delulu is the mastermind! He’s the one you need to catch!
[OuterPol]: @Delulu, stay exactly where you are. 
[OuterPol]: Your "Developer" just ratted you out to save his own skin.
[Delulu]: Hold up, Agent. 
[Delulu]: This sounds like a scam
[OuterPol]: He says you’re the "Founder" of this organized theft ring.
[Delulu]: Agent, you’re confusing urself 
[Delulu]: I just bought an app! 
[OuterPol]: We’re at your door, Delulu.
[Delulu]: Wait! 
[Delulu]: I’m helping the economy! 
[Admin_Food]: HE’S THE BRAINS, AGENT!
[Delulu]: Man, I wish you’d told me earlier
[OuterPol]: Open the door
[Admin_Food]: I HATE THIS STARTUP.
[Delulu]: <media: handcuffs.jpg>
<Delulu has been disconnected by the Outerpol>
[Admin_Food]: Any more orders sir?
